"""
Completion support for MCP servers.

This module implements the argument completion system for the MCP (Model Control Protocol)
servers, enabling interactive, context-aware autocompletion for tool arguments. The completion
system helps users and LLMs efficiently use tools by suggesting valid values for arguments
based on the current context.

Key Components:
- CompletionProvider (abstract): Base class for all completion providers
- StaticCompletionProvider: Provides completions from predefined, static lists
- DynamicCompletionProvider: Generates completions on-demand through callback functions
- CompletionRegistry: Central registry managing providers for different tools
- Utility functions: Helper functions for common completion scenarios (file paths, etc.)

The module supports a flexible, extensible architecture where:
1. Each tool can register its own providers for different arguments
2. Static lists can be used for enumerated options (e.g., formats, modes)
3. Dynamic functions can be used for context-dependent values (files, users, etc.)
4. A fallback provider can handle common arguments across tools

Usage Example:
```python
# Create completion registry
registry = CompletionRegistry()

# Register static provider for a specific tool
registry.register_provider("document_tool", StaticCompletionProvider({
    "format": ["pdf", "txt", "docx"],
    "language": ["en", "es", "fr", "de"]
}))

# Register dynamic provider for another tool
registry.register_provider("database_tool", DynamicCompletionProvider({
    "table_name": async_db_tables_function,
    "column_name": async_table_columns_function
}))

# Set default provider for common arguments across all tools
registry.set_default_provider(COMMON_COMPLETIONS)

# Later, when handling MCP completion requests:
completions = await registry.get_completions(
    tool_name="document_tool", 
    argument_name="format",
    current_value="pd"  # User has typed "pd" so far
)
# Returns: {"values": ["pdf"], "hasMore": False, "total": 1}
```

This system integrates with the MCP server to provide real-time completion
suggestions as users type, significantly improving usability and reducing errors.

class CompletionProvider:

    Abstract base class defining the interface for argument completion providers.
    
    CompletionProvider serves as the foundation for all completion mechanisms in the MCP
    system. It defines a consistent interface that all provider implementations must follow,
    ensuring that consumers of completions can work with different providers interchangeably.
    
    To implement a custom completion provider:
    1. Subclass CompletionProvider
    2. Implement the get_completions() method to return suggestions
    3. Implement the supports_argument() method to indicate what arguments your provider handles
    
    The framework includes two standard implementations:
    - StaticCompletionProvider: Uses predefined lists of values
    - DynamicCompletionProvider: Generates values dynamically via callback functions
    
    Custom implementations might include providers that:
    - Query external APIs for suggestions
    - Read from databases or other data sources
    - Implement complex filtering or ranking logic
    - Cache results for performance optimization
    
    Providers should handle any internal errors gracefully and return an empty list rather
    than raising exceptions that would disrupt the completion flow.

    Completion provider that returns predefined, static suggestion lists for arguments.
    
    This provider implements a straightforward approach to argument completion using
    predefined lists of suggestions for each supported argument name. When queried,
    it filters these static lists based on the current user input prefix. This makes it
    ideal for arguments with a fixed, known set of possible values like:
    
    - Enumerated options (e.g., file formats, provider names)
    - Common settings or modes (e.g., analysis types, priority levels)
    - Frequently used values that rarely change
    
    The provider automatically performs case-insensitive prefix matching on the
    predefined suggestions when a partial value is provided. For example, if 
    completions include ["openai", "anthropic"] and the current_value is "open",
    only "openai" will be returned.
    
    Usage example:
        ```python

    - Depend on the current system state (e.g., existing files, running processes)
    - Vary based on user context or previous selections
    - Are too numerous to predefine (e.g., all possible file paths)
    - Require external API calls or database queries to determine
    
    The provider maps argument names to async callback functions that are responsible
    for generating appropriate suggestions based on the current partial input and context.
    Each callback function should accept at least two parameters:
    - current_value: The current partial input string

    Central registry managing completion providers for different tools and arguments.
    
    The CompletionRegistry serves as the core orchestration component of the MCP completion
    system, providing a unified interface for registration, management, and access to
    completion providers. It implements:
    
    1. Tool-specific provider registration and lookup
    2. A fallback mechanism through a default provider
    3. Standardized response formatting according to the MCP specification
    4. Error handling and graceful degradation
    
    This registry is designed to be the single entry point for all completion requests
    in an MCP server. Client code can register different providers for different tools,
    set up a default provider for common arguments, and then handle all completion requests
    through a single, consistent interface.
    
    Each tool in the system can have its own dedicated completion provider that understands
    the specific requirements and valid values for that tool's arguments. When no specific
    provider is registered for a tool, the registry falls back to the default provider,
    which typically handles common arguments like formats, providers, and models.
    
    Usage workflow:
    1. Create a registry during server initialization
    2. Register tool-specific providers for specialized tools
    3. Set a default provider for common arguments
    4. Use get_completions() to handle MCP completion protocol requests

        Each tool can have exactly one registered provider. If a provider is already

# Example usage for file path completion
async def complete_file_paths(current_value: str, **context) -> List[str]:
    """
    Generate filesystem path completion suggestions based on the current input.
    
    This utility function provides intelligent path suggestions for file-related arguments,
    making it easier for users to navigate and select files or directories in the filesystem.
    It handles various path formats including relative paths, absolute paths, and user home
    directory references.
    
    Behavior:
    - For empty input: Returns common starting points ("./", "../", "/")
    - For partial paths: Performs glob matching to find all matching files and directories
    - For directories: Appends a trailing slash to distinguish them from files
    - Expands user directory references (e.g., "~/documents" becomes "/home/user/documents")
    
    Path matching is case-sensitive or case-insensitive depending on the underlying filesystem.
    On Windows, matching is typically case-insensitive, while on Unix-like systems it's case-sensitive.
    
    The function handles permission errors gracefully - if a directory cannot be accessed due to
    permission restrictions, it will be excluded from results without raising an exception.
    
    Args:
        current_value: The current path string provided by the user (can be empty, partial, or complete)
        **context: Additional context that may influence completions:
            - working_directory: Optional alternative directory to use as the base for relative paths
            - file_extensions: Optional list of file extensions to filter results (e.g., [".py", ".txt"])
            - include_hidden: Optional boolean to include hidden files/directories (default: False)
        
    Returns:
        List of path suggestions that match or extend the current_value. Each suggestion is formatted as:
        - Regular files: The full path to the file (e.g., "./src/main.py")
        - Directories: The full path with a trailing slash (e.g., "./src/utils/")
        
    Examples:
        - Input: "" → Output: ["./", "../", "/"]
        - Input: "doc" → Output: ["documents/", "docker-compose.yml", "dockerfile"]
        - Input: "~/Down" → Output: ["/home/user/Downloads/"]
        - Input: "./src/" → Output: ["./src/main.py", "./src/utils/", "./src/tests/"]
        
    Edge Cases:
        - Symlinks: Followed to their target with the symlink path in the results
        - Special files: Included in results, treated as regular files
        - Non-existent paths: Returns partial matches based on the parent directory, if any
        - Permission errors: Silently skips directories that cannot be accessed
        
    Notes:
        - Results are capped at 100 items to comply with MCP specification
        - Directory suggestions always end with a trailing slash
        - The function handles filesystem errors gracefully, returning empty list on access errors

# Example completions for common arguments
"""
Predefined completion provider for common argument types used across multiple tools.

This global provider instance contains standardized suggestion lists for frequently
used arguments in the MCP system. It serves as a convenient default provider that
can be registered with the CompletionRegistry for tools that don't need specialized
completion providers.

The included completion lists cover:
- provider: Common LLM provider names (e.g., "openai", "anthropic")
- model: Popular model identifiers from various providers
- format: Standard data formats for input/output
- source_type: Common data source types for analysis tools
- analysis_type: Standard categories of analysis operations

Usage example:
```python
# Set as the default provider in a registry to handle common arguments
registry = CompletionRegistry()
registry.set_default_provider(COMMON_COMPLETIONS)

# Later, even for tools without specific providers, common arguments will work:
await registry.get_completions(
    tool_name="any_tool",
    argument_name="provider",
    current_value="open"  # Will match "openai"
)
```

This provider can be extended with additional arguments by creating a new
StaticCompletionProvider that combines these defaults with tool-specific completions.
