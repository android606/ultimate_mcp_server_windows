class ExampleTool:
    """
    Example implementation of a well-structured MCP tool with best practices.
    
    The ExampleTool class serves as a reference implementation that demonstrates how to properly
    design and implement tools for the Model Control Protocol (MCP) ecosystem. It showcases
    a real-world RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) tool that interacts with a knowledge base.
    
    Key design features:
    - Proper tool registration with the MCP server
    - Comprehensive schema definitions for inputs and outputs
    - Clear tool descriptions with usage guidance for LLMs
    - Tool annotations that provide semantic hints about tool behavior
    - Consistent error handling and input validation
    - Well-structured implementation with clean separation of concerns
    
    The class implements a search_knowledge_base tool that allows querying a vector store
    containing sample documents. The implementation demonstrates how to:
    - Process input parameters and apply validation
    - Interact with external services (the knowledge base)
    - Format response data in a consistent structure
    - Handle errors gracefully with meaningful error messages
    - Add appropriate metadata to help LLMs use the tool effectively
    
    This implementation is intended as an educational reference for developers creating
    their own MCP tools, showing patterns and practices that lead to tools that are
    easily discoverable, usable, and maintainable.
    
    Usage:
        ```python
        # Initialize the MCP server
        server = MCPServer()
        
        # Create an instance (automatically registers all tools)
        tool = ExampleTool(server)
        
        # The tool is now available for use through the server
        # After ensuring the knowledge base is set up
        await setup_demo_kb()
        ```
    """
    
    def __init__(self, mcp_server):
        """
        Initialize an ExampleTool instance and register its tools with the MCP server.
        
        This constructor creates a new instance of the ExampleTool class and automatically
        registers all tools implemented by this class with the provided MCP server. It
        serves as the entry point for integrating the example tools into an MCP server.
        
        The initialization process:
        1. Stores a reference to the provided MCP server instance
        2. Calls the _register_tools method to define and register all tools
        3. Establishes all necessary connections to the underlying knowledge base
        
        After initialization, the tools become available for use through the MCP server's
        tool invocation interface. No further setup is required for the tools themselves,
        although the underlying knowledge base (see setup_demo_kb) must be initialized
        before the tools can be used effectively.

        Returns:
            None
            
        Notes:
            - Tool registration happens immediately during initialization
            - Tool usage requires the demo knowledge base to be set up separately
            - The server instance is stored but not modified beyond tool registration

        This private method is called during initialization and handles the registration
        of all tools implemented by the ExampleTool class. It defines and registers 
        individual tools with appropriate metadata, schemas, and implementations.
        
        For each tool, the method:
        1. Creates tool annotations with appropriate behavioral hints
        2. Defines the tool's description, input schema, and output schema
        3. Implements the tool function with error handling and input validation
        4. Registers the complete tool with the MCP server
        
        The primary tool defined here is:
        - search_knowledge_base: Searches the demo knowledge base for relevant documents

async def setup_demo_kb():
    """
    Creates and populates the demo knowledge base with sample documents.
    
    This function handles the initialization of the demo knowledge base used by
    the example tools. It performs the following operations in sequence:
    1. Creates a new knowledge base with the name defined in DEMO_KB_NAME
    2. Extracts documents, metadata, and IDs from the SAMPLE_DOCUMENTS constant
    3. Adds the extracted information to the newly created knowledge base
    
    The knowledge base is created with overwrite=True, which means any existing
    knowledge base with the same name will be deleted and recreated. This ensures
    a clean starting state for the demo.
    
    Each document in the sample data is structured with:
    - id: Unique identifier for the document
    - title: Document title
    - text: The actual document content to be vectorized
    - type: Document category (article, tutorial, reference, faq)
    - level: Difficulty level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
    - date: Publication date in YYYY-MM-DD format
    - score_for_ranking: A number between 0-1 used for demonstration purposes
    
    The function logs its progress to stdout and raises any exceptions it encounters,
    allowing the caller to handle failures appropriately.
    
    Returns:
        None
        
    Raises:
        Exception: If any step in the setup process fails. The original exception is
                 preserved and propagated with context information.

async def teardown_demo_kb():
    """
    Deletes the demo knowledge base and cleans up associated resources.
    
    This function is responsible for properly disposing of the demo knowledge base
    after the examples have been run. It ensures that temporary resources created
    for demonstration purposes don't persist unnecessarily. Specifically, it:
    
    1. Attempts to delete the knowledge base identified by DEMO_KB_NAME
    2. Logs the success or failure of the operation to stdout
    3. Suppresses any exceptions to prevent cleanup errors from propagating
    
    Unlike setup_demo_kb(), this function does not raise exceptions for failures,
    as cleanup errors should not prevent the application from continuing or shutting
    down normally. Instead, errors are logged but suppressed.
    
    The function can be safely called multiple times or even if the knowledge base
    doesn't exist (the underlying delete_knowledge_base function should handle such cases).
    
    This function should be called during application shutdown or after example
    tools are no longer needed, typically in one of these contexts:
    - Server shutdown hooks/lifecycle events
    - After example demonstration is complete
    - During application cleanup phases
    
    Returns:
        None
    
    Usage:

        In production systems, more robust cleanup might involve tracking created
        resources and ensuring proper disposal even after unexpected termination.

def register_example_tools(mcp_server):
    """
    Register all example tools with the MCP server and set up required resources.
    
    This function serves as the main entry point for integrating the example tools
    into an MCP server instance. It instantiates the ExampleTool class, which registers 
    all individual tools with the provided server. Additionally, it handles concerns
    related to the setup and teardown of resources required by the example tools.
    
    Key responsibilities:
    1. Creates an instance of ExampleTool, which registers all example tools with the server
    2. Manages the initialization of required resources (demo knowledge base)
    3. Documents integration concerns and known limitations
    
    Integration notes:
    - The demo knowledge base (DEMO_KB_NAME) must be set up before tools are used
    - In a production environment, the async setup should be handled as part of the
      server lifecycle (e.g., using lifespan or startup events) rather than directly here
    - Current implementation leaves knowledge base setup as a separate step due to
      challenges with mixing sync/async code in the registration process
    
    Args:
        mcp_server: An instance of the MCP server to register tools with. This should be
                   a fully initialized server object with a working tool registration system.
                   
    Returns:
        None
        
    Usage:
        ```python
        # During server initialization:
        server = MCPServer()
        register_example_tools(server)
        
        # Remember to set up the knowledge base separately (due to async requirements):
        await setup_demo_kb()  # Before using the tools
        
        # And clean up when done:
        await teardown_demo_kb()  # After tools are no longer needed
        ```
    
    Known limitations:
    - Cannot perform async setup directly in this function due to sync/async boundary issues
    - Knowledge base setup must be handled separately as an async operation
    - Resource cleanup must also be manually triggered as an async operation
    """
    # Perform setup when tools are registered
    # Note: In a real server, setup/teardown might be handled differently (e.g., lifespan)
    # Running async setup directly here might block if called synchronously.
    # A better approach might be to trigger setup after server start.
    # For this example modification, we assume it can be awaited here or handled externally.
    # asyncio.run(setup_demo_kb()) # This would block if register_example_tools is sync
