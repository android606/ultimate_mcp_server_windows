"""
Tool annotations for MCP servers.

This module provides a standardized way to annotate tools with hints that help LLMs
understand when and how to use them effectively.

class ToolAnnotations:
    """
    Tool annotations providing hints to LLMs about tool behavior and usage patterns.
    
    ToolAnnotations supply metadata that helps LLMs make informed decisions about:
    - WHEN to use a particular tool (appropriate contexts and priority)
    - HOW to use the tool correctly (through examples and behavior hints)
    - WHAT the potential consequences of using the tool might be (read-only vs. destructive)
    - WHO should use the tool (assistant, user, or both via audience hints)
    
    These annotations serve as a bridge between tool developers and LLMs, providing
    crucial context beyond just function signatures and descriptions. For example, the
    annotations can indicate that a file deletion tool is destructive and should be used
    with caution, or that a search tool is safe to retry multiple times.
    
    The system supports four key behavioral hints:
    - read_only_hint: Tool doesn't modify state (safe for exploratory use)
    - destructive_hint: Tool may perform irreversible changes (use with caution)
    - idempotent_hint: Repeated calls with same arguments produce same results
    - open_world_hint: Tool interacts with external systems beyond the LLM's knowledge
    
    Additional metadata includes:
    - audience: Who can/should use this tool
    - priority: How important/commonly used this tool is
    - title: Human-readable name for the tool
    - examples: Sample inputs and expected outputs
    
    Usage example:
        ```python
        # For a document deletion tool
        delete_doc_annotations = ToolAnnotations(
            read_only_hint=False,       # Modifies state
            destructive_hint=True,      # Deletion is destructive
            idempotent_hint=True,       # Deleting twice has same effect as once
            open_world_hint=True,       # Changes external file system
            audience=["assistant"],     # Only assistant should use it
            priority=0.3,               # Lower priority (use cautiously)
            title="Delete Document",
            examples=[{
                "input": {"document_id": "doc-123"},
                "output": {"success": True, "message": "Document deleted"}
            }]
        )
        ```
    
    Note: All hints are advisory only - they don't enforce behavior but help LLMs
    make better decisions about tool usage.

        Initialize tool annotations.
        
        Args:
            read_only_hint: If True, indicates this tool does not modify its environment.
                Tools with read_only_hint=True are safe to call for exploration without
                side effects. Examples: search tools, data retrieval, information queries.
                Default: False
                
            destructive_hint: If True, the tool may perform destructive updates that
                can't easily be reversed or undone. Only meaningful when read_only_hint 
                is False. Examples: deletion operations, irreversible state changes, payments.
                Default: True
                
            idempotent_hint: If True, calling the tool repeatedly with the same arguments
                will have no additional effect beyond the first call. Useful for retry logic.
                Only meaningful when read_only_hint is False. Examples: setting a value,
                deleting an item (calling it twice doesn't delete it twice).
                Default: False
                
            open_world_hint: If True, this tool may interact with systems or information 
                outside the LLM's knowledge context (external APIs, file systems, etc.).
                If False, the tool operates in a closed domain the LLM can fully model.
                Default: True
                
            audience: Who is the intended user of this tool, as a list of roles:
                - "assistant": The AI assistant can use this tool
                - "user": The human user can use this tool
                Default: ["assistant"]
                
            priority: How important this tool is, from 0.0 (lowest) to 1.0 (highest).
                Higher priority tools should be considered first when multiple tools
                might accomplish a similar task. Default: 0.5 (medium priority)
                
            title: Human-readable title for the tool. If not provided, the tool's
                function name is typically used instead.
                
            examples: List of usage examples, each containing 'input' and 'output' keys.
                These help the LLM understand expected patterns of use and responses.
